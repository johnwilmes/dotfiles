# KEYBINDINGS

# SET VIA /etc/default/keyboard INSTEAD!
# (Otherwise, gets clobbered by gnome whenever keyboard is plugged in, or wake from suspend)
# map caps to ctrl
#setxkbmap -option 'caps:ctrl_modifier'

# map both the alt key and the super key to the alt key
#setxkbmap -option 'altwin:alt_win'

# map the caps key to escape when tapped (but still let it be used as ctrl modifier)
#xcape -e 'Caps_Lock=Escape'

# actually, map all ctrl keys to escape also 
# (Need this in VM where host already has Caps mapped to ctrl)
xcape -e 'Caps_Lock=Escape;Control_L=Escape;Control_R=Escape'
